The story is about a boy who had some sheep. He was not happy and wanted to play a trick on the people who lived near him. He said a big bad wolf was coming to eat his sheep, but he was lying.
The people came to help him, but they saw no wolf. They were mad and told him not to lie. The boy did this two more times and thought it was funny.
The last time, a real wolf came and wanted to eat his sheep. The boy said help, help, but the people did not listen to him. They thought he was lying again. They did not help him and he lost his sheep.
The story ends with an old man telling the boy that lying is bad and people will not trust you if you lie.
